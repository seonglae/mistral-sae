# Sparse Autoencoder for Mistral 7b

This a sparse autoencoder I trained on the residual activations of Mistral 7b. The implementation is largely based on [Scaling and evaluating sparse autoencoders (Gao et al. 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04093v1).

I was inspired to do this after seeing [Golden Gate Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/golden-gate-claude).
